# poisson-glm

This repo contains code for applying Point Process Generalized
Linear Models to neural spiking data. I've also, in the 
"simulate" directory, added some code for simulating different
spatial cell types, and verified that we can recover things 
like the centre and width of place fields, and the preferred 
heading direction cells are tuned to. 


A lot of the reasoning for these analyses are taken from Kass, Eden & Brown (2014).
